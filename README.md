# Used Car Pricing Model

The primary goal is to build an accurate pricing model for used cars. Extensive work will be performed in high-quality data collection, feature engineering, and model tuning.

How does this differ from a [Kaggle used car competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/1056lab-used-cars-price-prediction)?
- Big data
- Accurate pricing
- More extensive features

Data:
- Used car listings scraped from public sites
- True transactions prices collected from state DMV registrations

Dataset Features:
- Price
- Car details and options
- Location

Additionial Engineered Features:
- Industry and market conditions
- National and local inventories
- Variable consumer elasticities
- External competition

Models:
- Linear regression baseline
- XGBoost
- SAINT

Other research areas:
- List prices vs sales prices (negotiation effectiveness)
- Changes over time, especially given recent disruptions
- Unique segments

## Deadlines
