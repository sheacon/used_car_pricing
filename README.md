# Used Car Pricing Algorithm

Our used car pricing algorithm offers businesses a competitive edge in predicting the final retail transaction price of vehicles, enabling better decision-making, inventory calibration, and avoidance of costly errors.

By leveraging a proprietary dataset that combines private transaction prices from state title registrations, extensive dealer listings, in-depth vehicle specifications, and external economic data, our model identifies complex pricing patterns.

In addition, we target multiple price quantiles to provide a spread of potential retail selling prices with less susceptibility to outliers.

Our approach allows the user to make informed decisions and pricing adjustments as needed at any stage of the acquisition, reconditioning, and sales processes.
