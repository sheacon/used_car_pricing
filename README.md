# Used Car Predictive Pricing Model

It is the goal of my project to build a predictive model that accurately prices this asset using publicly available information on used car listings and the ultimate sale price as indicated in vehicle registration records.

- List prices vs sales prices (negotiation)
- Predictive tool
- Significant data collection
- Consumer perspective: what negotiated price can I get?
- Dealer perspective: what price to list to meet certain profit margin?
