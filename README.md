# Used Car Pricing Model

- NOTE: This project will fulfill the capstone/thesis requirement for graduation from my master's degree program this spring. It is in the early stages of development.

## Scoping

The primary goal is to build an accurate pricing model for used cars. Extensive work will be performed in high-quality data collection, feature engineering, and model tuning.

Data:
- Used car listings scraped from public sites
- True transactions prices collected from state DMV registrations

Engineered Features:
- Industry and market conditions
- National and local inventories
- Variable consumer elasticities
- External competition

Models:
- Linear regression baseline
- XGBoost
- SAINT

Other research areas:
- List prices vs sales prices (negotiation effectiveness)
- Changes over time, especially given recent disruptions
- Unique segments
