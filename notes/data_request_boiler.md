I am working on my master's thesis in data science at Vanderbilt University. My research question involves taking publicly available information to make predictions on the sales prices of used vehicles. My understanding is that DMV records in Ohio include used car sales prices. 

Too properly research price trends over time, ideally I could obtain statewide data for the period of a year or more with VIN-level detail. I don't know how common this type of request is, but I can conform to whatever confidentiality standard is necessary. My research report would not include any personally identifiable information from the data, only broad trends. However, I do need VIN data to match to sales postings and other car data I've collected.  

Please let me know what other information is needed for this request. Any help you can provide is much appreciated! Thanks!
