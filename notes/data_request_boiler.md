I am working on my master's thesis in data science at Vanderbilt University. My research question involves taking publicly available information to make predictions on the sales prices of used vehicles. My understanding is that DMV records in Ohio include used car sales prices. 

To properly research price trends over time, ideally I could obtain statewide data for the period of a year or more with VIN-level detail. I don't know how common this type of request is, but I can conform to whatever confidentiality standard is necessary. My research report would not include any personally identifiable information from the data, only broad trends. However, I do need VIN data to match to sales postings and other car data I've collected.  

Please let me know what other information is needed for this request. Any help you can provide is much appreciated! Thanks!

My name is Shea Conaway, and I'm a student at Vanderbilt University doing research for my master's thesis in data science.

My topic compares modelling approaches for estimations of used car prices over time, as well as comparisons between public listings and ultimate transaction price.

To properly conduct my research, I would need data on the actual sales prices of vehicles, and it's my understanding that the best place to get this is from vehicle registrations.

I would like to submit a FOIA request for relevant records, but first I want to better understand what data is available and how you prefer to consider such requests.

Has your department worked with academic researchers in the past? Is there a good time you'd be willing to discuss on the phone?

Thank You Very Much and Happy Holidays!
